# Machine-Learning-Interview-Questions
### Here, one will find important ML questions that are asked in many interviews. Companies like Amazon, JP Morgan, Morgan Stanley, Goldman Sachs, Wells Fargo, BlinkIt, HSBC, Standard Chartered, Intuit, AIRA Matrix, Aditya Birla, FinArb etc has asked these/this type of questions.

All these questions were asked to students who wanted a post in the field of Data Science.


## Q1) What is the direction of gradient descent?
To answer this basic question let us first understand the individual meaning of the words in the true sense of the term.
So, let us first understand gradient. <br/> 
The direction of the gradient, points to the direction of the greatest increase of the function, and the magnitude of the gradient tells you how steep the function is in that direction. So, basically gradient is the direction in which the function increases fast.
'Descent' means moving downward.

``` diff 
-Hence, gradient descent is an algorithm that finds a local minimum of a function by taking repeated steps in the opposite direction of the gradient.
 ```
